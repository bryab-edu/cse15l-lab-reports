In this first image I typed the commands `javac ListExmaples.java` and `java ListExamples` accordingly

Keys pressed: `<Ctrl+r>`, by searching using keyword `java` the command `java ListExamples` my most recent command entered shows up.

Keys pressed: `<up>` I now scroll through the previous command using the `<up>` directional key to go back to another command I entered with keyword `java` and so `javac ListExmaples.java` shows up

Keys pressed: `<down>` now, to go back to newer entries of commands using the keyword `java` I can go back to `java ListExamples` using the `<down>` directional key
